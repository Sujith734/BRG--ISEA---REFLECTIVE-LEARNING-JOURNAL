# Lab 1 – VirtualBox & Ubuntu Setup

## Purpose  
To install a Linux environment using VirtualBox and Ubuntu in order to perform all server and scripting labs safely inside a virtual machine.

## What I Did  
- Downloaded and installed VirtualBox (first time using it).  
- Downloaded Ubuntu ISO (large file, long download time).  
- Created a new VM in VirtualBox.  
- Allocated:  
  - 4GB RAM  
  - 20GB disk  
  - 1 CPU  
- Installed Ubuntu (took ~10 minutes copying files).  
- Booted into Ubuntu and explored the system settings, networking and terminal.

## Key Learning  
I learned how virtualization works, how resources are allocated to a VM, and why a separate Linux environment is useful for secure testing.
