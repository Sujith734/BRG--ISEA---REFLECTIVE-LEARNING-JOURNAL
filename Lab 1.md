# Lab 1 - VirtualBox and Ubuntu Setup

## Purpose
To install a Linux environment using VirtualBox and Ubuntu in order to perform all server and scripting labs safely inside a virtual machine.

## What I Did  
- VirtualBox was downloaded and installed for the first time.
- The Ubuntu ISO file was downloaded (large file, took a long time).
- A new virtual machine was created in VirtualBox.
- Resources were allocated as follows:
- 4GB RAM
- 20GB storage
- 1 CPU
- Ubuntu was installed, which took about 10 minutes to copy files.
- The system was successfully booted into Ubuntu, and the settings, networking, and terminal were explored.

## Key Learning

This activity showed how virtualization works, how hardware resources are shared with a virtual machine, and why using a separate Linux environment is important for safe testing and practice.
