# Lab 10 – SSL Certificates (Let’s Encrypt)

## Purpose

In this lab, I learned about HTTPS, SSL certificates, and how Certbot is used to manage them.

## What I Did

I couldn’t install an SSL certificate because I didn’t have a domain name or a public IP address. Even though I couldn’t do the practical part, I still studied how HTTPS works, including how data is encrypted and how the trust chain between browsers and certificate authorities works. I also checked certificate details on real websites using the browser security tools. In addition, I went through the Certbot documentation to understand how it automates SSL installation.

## Key Learning

I learned why HTTPS is important for security, how certificate authorities work, and how encryption protects data, even without setting up a real server.
