# Lab 11 – Backup Script & Cron Automation

## Purpose

In this lab, I learned how to automate backups using Bash scripting and Cron jobs.

## What I Did

- I created several practice scripts like `hello.sh`, `variables.sh`, and `maths.sh` to understand basic Bash scripting.
- After that, I created a backup script that stores selected files into a ZIP file with the current date as its name.
- I moved the script to `/usr/bin`, and at first I got an error because of a wrong path, but I fixed it after checking the directory properly.
- I then configured `crontab` to run the backup script automatically.
- Along the way, I faced permission and file path issues, and I learned how to troubleshoot and fix them.

## Key Learning

I learned how to write Bash scripts, automate tasks, debug errors, and schedule jobs using Cron for regular backups.
