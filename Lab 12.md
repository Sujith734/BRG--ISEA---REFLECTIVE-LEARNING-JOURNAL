# Lab 12 – MariaDB Installation & User Management

## Purpose
In this lab, I learned how to install MariaDB and manage users using SQL commands.

## What I Did

I installed the MariaDB server and ran the secure installation process to improve security. After that, I logged into MariaDB using sudo mysql. I created a new database called labdb, then created a new user and gave the user the required privileges. While doing this, I faced SQL errors like 1064 and 1396 because of wrong syntax, but I fixed them by correcting the commands. Finally, I tested and confirmed that the new user could log in successfully.

## Key Learning

I learned how databases authenticate users, how privileges are managed, and how to identify and fix common SQL syntax errors.
