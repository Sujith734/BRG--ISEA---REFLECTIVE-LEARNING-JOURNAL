# Lab 4 – Permissions & Ownership

## Purpose

I wanted to understand how Linux permissions and ownership work, and how they protect system files.

## What I Did

- First, I used  `ls -l ` to to check file permissions.
- Then I used  `chmod ` to change the permissions.
- At first I got some errors because I was in the wrong directory, so I learned to always check the path properly.
I used  `sudo chown ` to change the file owner.
I also learned that the user must already exist before I can change ownership to that user.

## Key Learning

This lab helped me understand how Linux protects files using permissions. I also learned why permission errors happen and how to fix them by checking the path and the user.
