# Lab 5 – Searching & Navigating the File System

## Purpose
I wanted to practice searching for files and extracting archive files.

## What I Did

- First, I tried to extract `Gutenberg.tar.bz2` using `bunzip2` and tar.
- I got some errors at the start, then I learned the difference between tar flags and file paths.
- I used `find` to search for files in the system.
- I used `grep` to search for specific words inside files.

Key Learning

This lab helped me understand how Linux stores and organizes files. I also learned how to fix extraction errors and how searching works using find and grep.
