# #Lab 6 - Total Cost of ownership (TCO)

Cloud Deployment

## Platform Used
My cloud setup used AWS.

- How I Created a VM Securely
I set up a new virtual machine on AWS at first. I chose a simple Linux image. I created a key pair to allow me access to the server. I created some security group rules and only allowed ports I need to use - the ports I need are SSH and HTTP. I updated the system after logging in. I blocked unused ports.

- Reflection on Cloud Setup
Creating a cloud VM was simple yet required some work. Security settings are just as important as making the VM as I understand them to be.

- TCO Comparison
I compared AWS to Azure and DigitalOcean. AWS was more flexible but a bit pricier. Azure had similar pricing but a more complex setup. For small projects, DigitalOcean was the cheapest and easiest.

- Criteria Considered
I went into cost, flexibility, and scalability. Cost is how cheaply it is over time. Flexibility means the breadth of options that I have to choose from. Scalability is how nimble it is to upgrade when I want additional power.

- Platform Recommendation
For small projects, I would recommend DigitalOcean since it is low-cost, simple, and straightforward to manage. On projects of bigger scales, AWS is the better choice—it has more features and is easily scalable.
