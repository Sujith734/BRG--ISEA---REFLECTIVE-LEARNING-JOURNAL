# Lab 6 - Total Cost of ownership (TCO)

Cloud Deployment

## Platform Used
My cloud setup used AWS.

- How I Created a VM Securely
I set up a new virtual machine on AWS at first. I chose a simple Linux image. I created a key pair to allow me access to the server. I created some security group rules and only allowed ports I need to use - the ports I need are SSH and HTTP. I updated the system after logging in. I blocked unused ports.

- Reflection on Cloud Setup
Creating a cloud VM was simple yet required some work. Security settings are just as important as making the VM as I understand them to be.

- TCO Comparison
I compared AWS to Azure and DigitalOcean. AWS was more flexible but a bit pricier. Azure had similar pricing but a more complex setup. For small projects, DigitalOcean was the cheapest and easiest.

- Criteria Considered
I went into cost, flexibility, and scalability. Cost is how cheaply it is over time. Flexibility means the breadth of options that I have to choose from. Scalability is how nimble it is to upgrade when I want additional power.

- Platform Recommendation
For small projects, I would recommend DigitalOcean since it is low-cost, simple, and straightforward to manage. On projects of bigger scales, AWS is the better choice—it has more features and is easily scalable.

# What I Did

I created a spreadsheet in Google Sheets to work out the Total Cost of Ownership (TCO). I entered assumptions such as how many pages are printed, how long cartridges last, electricity usage, and the price of each item. Using these values, I calculated the total cost for each printer over a 5-year period. From the results, I found that the laser printer was cheaper in the long run.

# Reflection Questions
Which printer is the best based on TCO?

The laser printer turned out to be the best choice over five years. Although it is more expensive to buy at first, its toner lasts much longer and the cost per page is lower, so the total spending over time is less than an inkjet.

Would this be the same for someone printing only 5 pages per week?

No. For very light home use, an inkjet printer is usually cheaper. Since it is used so little, the cartridges last a long time and the low purchase price becomes more important than long-term savings.

# What other things besides TCO should be considered?

- Print quality
- Printing speed
- Colour or black-and-white printing
- Reliability
- Warranty support
- Duty cycle
- Size and noise level
- Network and wireless features

# What features matter for a large office printer?

- Very high duty cycle
- Big paper trays
- Low cost per page
- Large toner capacity
- Fast printing
- Good network support
- Strong and durable build
