# Lab 8 – Bash Scripting & Regular Expressions

## Purpose

I wanted to practice creating files, writing basic Bash scripts, using loops and variables, and working with regular expressions.

## What I Did

- I used  `mkdir `,  `cd `,  `cp `,  `mv `, and  `rm ` to manage files.
- I created a script called  `hello_world.sh `.
- I used  `chmod 777 ` to fix permission errors.
- I edited the script to test variables, loops, and arithmetic operations.
- I created  `system_info.sh ` that takes user input and validates it.
- I faced errors and learned to debug issues with regex and input handling.
- Finally, I built  `resource_monitor.sh ` to automate system checks.

## Key Learning

I learned how Bash handles conditions and loops, how to work with variables, and how to troubleshoot and debug script errors.
