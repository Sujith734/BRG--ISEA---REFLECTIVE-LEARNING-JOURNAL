# Lab 9 – DNS Configuration & Testing

## Purpose

I wanted to understand how DNS works without actually deploying a DNS server.

## What I Did

- I couldn’t deploy a DNS server because I didn’t have a domain or cloud VM.
- Instead, I used Ubuntu to test DNS queries:
- `nslookup google.com`
- `dig ubuntu.com`
- This helped me see how domain names are translated into IP addresses.

## Key Learning

Even without setting up a server, I learned how DNS works and how domain names are resolved to IP addresses in the real world.
