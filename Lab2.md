# Lab 2 – Ubuntu Desktop & CLI Tools

## Purpose

To understand basic graphical and command-line tools in Ubuntu.

## What Was Done

- Explored the Ubuntu graphical interface, including Settings, Firefox, and File Manager.
- Used terminal commands such as:
  - `ps -e` to view running processes
  - `top` and pressing 1 to display CPU cores
  - `ls`, `ls` -`la`, `cp`, `mv`, `nano`, `cat`, `less` for file and directory management
- Created and edited files using both `gedit` and `nano` .
- Learned why terminal based editors like nano are used on servers where GUI tools are unavailable.
- Added new users using `sudo adduser`.
- Tested network connectivity using `ping 8.8.8.8`.
- Edited the `/etc/hosts` file to add a custom DNS entry called “GoogleEpicDNS”.
- Installed the `whois` tool and retrieved domain information for google.com.

##Key Learning

This lab increased understanding of Linux command-line usage, file management, user administration, and basic networking tasks.
